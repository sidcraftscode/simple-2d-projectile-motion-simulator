# Simple 2D Projectile Motion Simulator

A small 2D projectile motion demo to visualise basic kinematics.

You can launch a particle using either speed + angle or by setting the velocity components directly, and see the trajectory update in real time.

It shows the path, max height, and horizontal range. Gravity is constant and there’s no air resistance.

Built with plain JavaScript and bundled with Vite.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL to open in the browser.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
